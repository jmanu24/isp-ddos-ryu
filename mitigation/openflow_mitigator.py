    Mitigation backend for the OpenFlow / SDN domain.

    Installs high-priority drop rules to block traffic matching an
    attack's exact L4 flow — src_ip, dst_ip, protocol and dst_port —
    rather than blanket-blocking the source IP. Forwarding rules stay
    L3-only; only mitigation needs L4 precision.

    Scope:
    - Single-attacker block (src_ip != "*") with a known (dpid, in_port):
      installed on that ONE switch only, matching in_port too — the
      block sits on the switch+port closest to the attacker instead of
      the whole network.
    - Distributed attack (src_ip == "*") or unknown ingress point: falls
      back to every registered switch, matching the L4 5-tuple only —
      there's no single entry point to scope to.

    The controller registers/deregisters datapaths as switches connect
    and disconnect.
