"""
mitigation/peering_backend.py — BGP FlowSpec speaker for the Peering domain.

Talks to a locally running `exabgp` process, which holds the actual BGP
session to r1's `flow` instance (https://github.com/hack3ric/flow) --
NOT FRR. FRR's own FlowSpec-to-dataplane bridge builds the rule object
in memory but never actually installs it in the kernel; this is a
confirmed, long-standing gap in FRR mainline, not a configuration
mistake (see docs/peering-plan.md §2.1, FRRouting/frr#3160). `flow`
receives the same BGP FlowSpec NLRI and translates it into a real
nftables rule via rtnetlink -- confirmed with a live nftables rule (see
docs/peering-plan.md §2.2).

exabgp does NOT create or manage this FIFO itself -- deploy/
spike_flowspec_flow.sh (and, eventually, the real deployment config)
must `mkfifo` it and point exabgp's own config at it via a `process`
block that runs `cat <fifo path>`, whose stdout exabgp reads as
commands. This module only ever writes to that FIFO; it does not
implement BGP itself, nor does it manage the exabgp or flow processes.

CAPABILITY STATUS: announcing a FlowSpec discard route via this module
and having `flow` install it as a real nftables rule is CONFIRMED (see
docs/peering-plan.md §2.2 for the verified `nft list ruleset` output).
Still unverified: withdraw() actually removing that rule from `flow`
(the spike only exercised announce), and the measured *effect* on real
traffic once wired into the Mininet topology's r1 (see docs/
peering-plan.md §6). Per implementation-design.md §5's state machine,
apply()/announce()/withdraw() returning True here means DISPATCHED/
ACCEPTED -- do not report it to the UI/logs as APPLIED or VERIFIED
without the readback/effect measurement implementation-design.md §5
requires for those states.
