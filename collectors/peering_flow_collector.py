"""
collectors/peering_flow_collector.py — ingress flow telemetry for the BGP
Peering domain.

softflowd (on `br`, sniffing the real external-facing interface) exports
NetFlow v9/IPFIX directly to nfcapd, which writes rotated binary capture
files to PEERING_NFCAPD_DIR (see config/settings.py). This collector
never speaks the wire protocol itself -- it shells out to `nfdump`
(same suite as nfcapd) to decode each new capture file into per-flow CSV
records, the same "read via the vendor's own tool" pattern the rest of
this project uses (e.g. BNGBlaster telemetry) instead of reimplementing
IPFIX/NetFlow decoding here.

See docs/peering-plan.md for the FlowSpec-dataplane-support spike --
this telemetry path does NOT depend on it and works independently of
whether mitigation/peering_backend.py's announcements actually get
installed by r1's FRR.

nfcapd ALWAYS runs on the same host as this collector (wherever the
controller runs -- `orchestrator` in the distributed-VM lab, r1's own
namespace in Mininet mode) -- softflowd is configured to export its
NetFlow stream THERE directly (settings.orchestrator_addr in
deploy/vm-lab/ansible/roles/br's softflowd-peering.service.j2, instead
of the 127.0.0.1 it used to point at when nfcapd ran alongside it on
`br`). That earlier remote-nfcapd-plus-SSH design was a Mininet-era
artifact kept past its usefulness: NetFlow export is UDP fire-and-
forget and already meant to be pointed at wherever the collector lives,
so redirecting the export is strictly simpler than polling a remote
host's disk over SSH for files this collector never needed to be
remote from in the first place. Confirmed on a real run: the SSH round
trip this replaced was the dominant cost of this domain's real pipeline
cycle time (~0.5s per call, at least once per COLLECT_INTERVAL), which
directly inflated how long UNBLOCK_CONFIRM_CYCLES took in wall-clock
time before a FlowSpec route got withdrawn.

    right alongside normally-completed nfcapd.<timestamp> ones -- see

    stops being named nfcapd.current.* -- no need to ALSO wait for a
    subsequent rotation to exist before trusting it, which earlier cost
    a full extra rotation interval of detection latency for nothing
