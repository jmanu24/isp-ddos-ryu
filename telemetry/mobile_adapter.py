class MobileNetworkAdapter(DomainAdapter):
    """
    Telemetry + mitigation adapter for the Mobile Network Domain (real
    srsRAN Project + Open5GS VM lab -- see docs/ran-testing.md).

    REPLACES the earlier ns-3/mmwave-LENA-oran simulated-scenario design
    (static config/ue_ip_map.csv + a KPM-CSV tail, both built against
    that fork's fake IMSI/IP assignment -- see git history for
    oran_bridge/amf_ue_ngap_id.py and oran_bridge/ue_ip_map.py, kept
    around only as historical reference for a scenario this lab no
    longer runs). That design produced synthetic numbers with no real
    backing at all; this one is built entirely on real, live testbed
    state.

    Telemetry (collect()): a single HTTP GET per cycle to
    oran_bridge/ue_telemetry_api.py -- a small persistent service that
    runs on core5g itself (NOT on this process), since that's the one
    place both halves of what this domain needs actually live:

      - identity (amf_ue_ngap_id -> imsi -> ip), from Open5GS's own
        AMF/SMF docker logs -- there is no live query API in Open5GS
        for this (WebUI's own REST API is subscriber CRUD against
        MongoDB only, confirmed by reading its server/routes/db.js --
        no live session state ever reaches Mongo).
      - real per-(UE ip, destination) volumetric flow data, from the
        kernel's own conntrack table on core5g -- every UE's uplink
        traffic is decapsulated onto core5g's single ogstun interface,
        so this is a real, complete, OpenFlow/enterprise-domain-
        independent view of exactly what each UE is sending where.

    This adapter itself never tails a log or opens an SSH connection --
    it only ever does a plain, cheap HTTP GET, the same shape
    telemetry/broadband_adapter.py's own _read_active_scenario() already
    uses for suscriptor's /active_scenario endpoint. ue_telemetry_api.py
    already joins the two halves above server-side, so each row it
    returns maps directly onto one TelemetryEvent.

    Mitigation (apply_mitigation()): the decided block/unblock action is
    delivered to the Near-RT RIC as a real E2SM-RC Control Request by
    oran_bridge/rc_actuator_xapp.py (Style 2 / Action 6, slice-level PRB
    quota on the DU E2 node serving the attacking UE). This adapter keeps
    two delivery paths, both fed the same command:
      - a live HTTP POST to that actuator's /rc endpoint
        (settings.MOBILE_RC_ACTUATOR_URL) -- best-effort, short timeout,
        so an unreachable RIC never stalls the pipeline cycle;
      - an append to a JSONL command queue (one line per command), which
        the offline simulator/analysis consumers tail and which doubles
        as an audit log.
    The POST is skipped (queue-only) when MOBILE_RC_ACTUATOR_URL is empty,
    so this stays usable in environments with no live RIC.
